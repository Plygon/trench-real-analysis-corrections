This repository contains minor edits (typo corrections) and notes about [Introduction to Real Analysis by William F. Trench](https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/mono/7/), an open access textbook provided under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed).

For the most part, each commit corresponds to one small change. Hopefully this will make it easy to follow exactly what was changed, and to revert some changes if you do not feel they are improvements.

This repository contains only the LaTeX source code. You will need to compile it in a LaTeX environment. The file structure is identical
to the [official source code download](https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1006&context=mono&type=additional),
except this repository has an additional file, [notes.tex](https://github.com/Plygon/trench-real-analysis-corrections/blob/main/notes.tex).
This file contains just a couple notes of potential changes that are bigger than mere typo corrections, and that I was not confident enough in to put into the book.
