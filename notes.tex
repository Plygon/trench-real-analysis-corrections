\item {
        Exercise 4.5.5 is incorrect. First, it says ``...and $k \geq k$''. I assume that it is instead supposed to say ``Show that there is an integer $K$ such that ... and $k \geq K$''. But still, there is a counterexample. Consider
    \begin{equation*}
        f(x) = \frac 1 {1 - x}, \qquad a_n = 1, \quad n \geq 0
    \end{equation*}
    Then $x_0 = 0$, and $R = 1$, and
    \begin{equation*}
        \left|f(x) - \sum_{n = 0}^k a_n x^n\right| \to \infty \text{ as } x \to 1^-.
    \end{equation*}
    This contradicts the desired inequality for all $k$.
}

\item Exercise 5.4.7 is unrelated to the topic of the section, and would fit better in section 3.3.
